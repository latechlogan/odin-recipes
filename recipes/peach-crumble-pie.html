        <ul>
          <li>1 (9-inch) prepared pie crust</li>
          <li>9 fresh peaches, peeled and halved</li>
          <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
          <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230
            degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine sugar, flour, butter, and salt in a bowl; mix with your
            fingers until it has a pea-sized, crumbly texture.
          </li>
          <li>Sprinkle 1/3 of the mixture into pie crust.</li>
          <li>
            Lay peach halves, flat-sides down, onto crumb mixture. Cut remaining
            peach halves into sections and place in between the halves to fill
            any spaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle remaining crumble mixture on top and sprinkle with nutmeg.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 400
            degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to bake until golden brown,
            about 30 minutes more.
          </li>
